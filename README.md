# Robotic System Simulation
This project demonstrates the simulation of a robotic system, designed using SolidWorks. The project implements both forward and inverse kinematics to control the robot's movements. Additionally, trajectory planning is performed using waypoints in the workspace.

## Software used
Matlab 2023a
