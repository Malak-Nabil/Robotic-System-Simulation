# Robotic System Simulation
This project demonstrates the simulation of a robotic system, designed using SolidWorks. The project implements both forward and inverse kinematics to control the robot's movements. Additionally, trajectory planning is performed using waypoints in the workspace.

## Software used
• SolidWorks (for mechanical design)

• Matlab 2023a (for kinematics and simulation)

## Usage
1. Open robot_simulation in MATLAB
2. Load the workspace
3. Modify time values in trajectory planning block to set your desired simulation duration and time resolution
4. Modify the waypoints in workspace to define the desired trajectory for the robot.
5. Run the Simulation
